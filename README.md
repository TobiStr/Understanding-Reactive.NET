# Understanding-Reactive.NET

This repository is a showcase on how to correctly use Reactive Extensions in .NET.

To this date I have not found a detailed source on how to correctly use all those Reactive Extensions in .NET.
I've found myself many times making mistakes or misunderstanding the behavior of some Reactive Extensions, so i decided to create this repository and create tests and benchmarks on every extension there is.
